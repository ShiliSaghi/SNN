# SNN
Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is an emerging field that brings together two technologies that we often think of as separate: sensing and wireless data transfer. In a traditional system, there is one device or signal for ’seeing’ objects (like a radar) and another for ’communicating’ with other devices. ISAC combines these into a single system, letting us use the same signals, antennas, and hardware to both sense the environment and transfer data. This saves spectrum, power, and cost, and it is exactly what future applications like smart cars, drones, and the Internet of Things will need. In our work, we use a special kind of neural network called a Spiking Neural Network (SNN). Unlike ordinary deep networks, SNNs communicate via short electrical “spikes,” much like real neurons in the brain. We feed these SNNs with pulse-position–modulated impulse radio signals. The network has two ’heads’: one head learns to decide whether a target is present (classification), and the other predicts the target’s propagation delay (regression), all at once. To test our system under realistic conditions, we built simulated wireless channels, including random background echoes (clutter) and noise. By changing the statistical properties of the target and clutter sig- nals, we created 12 datasets to see how well the network could learn to separate “real” targets from distracting echoes. This approach explores how statistical separation affects target detectability via SNNs.
